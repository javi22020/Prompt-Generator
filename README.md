# Prompt-Generator
Use this project to create your own random prompts for Stable Diffusion! Besides, you'll be able to add your own adjectives, objects and styles in the code.

Using main.py, or modifying it, you can generate the prompts that you want. This is a less rich version of AUTOMATIC1111 PromptGen, but it doesn't need as much resources and, used well, can give more specific prompts.
