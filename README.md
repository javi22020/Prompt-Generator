# Prompt-Generator
Use this project to create your own random prompts for Stable Diffusion! Besides, you'll be able to add your own adjectives, objects and styles in the code.

# Some use notes
- By using sdrnd.py, and modifying it, you can generate the prompts that you want.
- This is a less complex version of AUTOMATIC1111 PromptGen, but it doesn't need as much resources and, used well, can give more specific prompts.
- It's recommended to use this project in conjunction with AUTOMATIC1111 API: https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/API
